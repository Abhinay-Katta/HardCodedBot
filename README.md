# Noob_bot


  A simple bot made with a few packages and if else statements. You can also add your own commands to make the bot do simple things you want it to. It takes an input from user,
  compares it to a string and does the operation. :)

## Usage:
1. Run setup.sh
2. Add folder path to environment variables 
3. Execute the bot by running the command `noobBot`
