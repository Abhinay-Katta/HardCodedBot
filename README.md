# HardCodedBot
### Previously called as NoobBot
### Made using PyQt6 and app compiled with Pyinstaller
 
A voice assistant written in Python and PyQt6 that allows you to perform tasks using voice commands. The application initially started as a simple Python script and later a GUI was added with PyQt6. The application can be compiled using PyInstaller and it plays a GIF while assisting you with voice commands. More commands will be added in the future and development is still in progress.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Abhinay-Katta/HardCodedBot

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running

3. Compile the application using PyInstaller:

4. Edit the ```.spec``` file according to your wish.
5. Run the command to build from the ```.spec``` file :
```
pyinstaller noobBot.spec

## Usage
